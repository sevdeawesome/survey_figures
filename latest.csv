I think it's very unlikely that the current generation of autoregressive models will come close to what we call 'general intelligence'. Look at how difficult it is to control model ""hallucination"" (a brilliant marketing term, I'll admit).

As we can see from Chernobyl and 3 mile island accidents, containment is only an intrinsic part of modern nuclear research due to public pressure and failure when it didn't use to be the case. Ignoring malicious human actors (which we shouldn't but, for the sake of argument, let's assume there aren't any) if building AGI becomes a race, then more difficult safety concerns will be discarded in the hope that a given team will get to the minimum viable AGI before anyone else, allowing for a misaligned AGI loose onto the world. Not to mention that safety research might be difficult to communicate or be counter to economic interests of powerful groups, such as the climate change issue we are currently facing causing a repeat of the same distrust in science and research related to safety. All of this is assuming that AGI will just lead to something akin to a company run by an AGI with misaligned goals, whereas the exponential take off could also be a (remote) possibility; where we only invent AGI once, and so the need for it to be understood and aligned is even more paramount!",
